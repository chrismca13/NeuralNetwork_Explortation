# Neural Network Exploration

The goal of this notebook is to compare the increase in accuracy by using neural networks to classify a non-linear dataset when compared to classical machine learning models.

In this notebook we will:
1. Generate a toy datasets
2. Create a Logistic Regression
3. Create a Simple Random Forest
4. Create a slightly more complext random forest
5. Create a simple neural network
6. Tune that neural network

We also draw the decision boundary for all of the models like in the image above.
